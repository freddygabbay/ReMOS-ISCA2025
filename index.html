    <h1>ReMoS 2025 Workshop - Call for Papers</h1>
    <h1>Reliability-Aware Modeling and Simulation: Addressing System Faults in Modern Chips</h1>

    <p>June 21st 2025 @ Tokyo, Japan</p>

    <p>Held in conjunction with <a href="https://iscaconf.org/isca2025/">ISCA 2025</a></p>


    <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
    <p>
        As semiconductor technologies continue to advance and chiplet integration becomes more widespread, the demand for highly reliable systems has never been greater. Modern chips face increasing susceptibility to various reliability-related mechanisms (described by different fault models) such as manufacturing defects, device variability, marginalities, aging, voltage drop. These faults pose significant challenges to the design of robust systems, as their impact can cascade from the physical level to the overall system level, affecting architecture, software, performance, functionality, and safety and leading to systems that either observably don’t operate (crash) or, even worse, produce unnoticed corrupted outputs (silent errors, silent data corruptions). To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for efficient modeling and simulation frameworks that can accurately capture and analyze the effects of these fault mechanisms across multiple abstraction levels.
    </p>
    <p>
        This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to discuss state-of-the-art techniques for modeling, simulation, and on top of them mitigation of reliability-related mechanisms in modern silicon chips and systems built on them. We invite contributions that explore innovative approaches to fault modeling, simulation environments, and methodologies for evaluating and improving system reliability in the presence of silicon faults and marginalities.
